# Hunter Alpha

A modular Telegram Python bot running on python3 with a sqlalchemy database and an entirely themed persona to make Naruto suitable for Anime and Manga group chats. 

Can be found on telegram as [Hunter Alpha (bot)](http://t.me/xxXhunteralphaX_Bot).

The Support group can be reached out to at [Hunter Alpha Support](https://t.me/AlphaEliasxd), where you can ask for help about [Hunter Alpha (bot)](https://t.me/xxXhunteralphaX_Bot), discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available :) 


## How to setup/deploy.

### Read these notes carefully before proceeding 
 - Edit any mentions of [@Hunter Alpha Support](https://t.me/AlphaEliasxd) Support to your own support chat
 - Your code must be open source and a link to your fork's repository must be there in the start reply of the bot [See this](https://github.com/AlphaEliasPY/AlphaHunter)
 - Lastly, if you are found to run this repo without the code being open sourced or the repository link not mentioned in the bot, we will push a gban for you in our network because of being in violation of the license, you are free to be a dick and not respect the open source code (we do not mind) but we will not be having you around our chats
 - This repo does not come with technical support, so DO NOT come to us asking help about deploy/console errors
